**Contents**
- Plot domains from namelist (plot_wrf_domains.py)

A collection of scripts that we use for processing and plotting WRF-Chem output. 
Scripts should specify what kind of file they act upon, e.g. Is the grid curvilinear or rectilinear?
Scripts should have a clear description of how to run to produce the output.
